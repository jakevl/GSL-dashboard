Water surface elevation of Gilbert Bay in the summer of 2002 was approximately 4,200 ft (m), about the long-term average for the lake. Since then, 
the lake elevation has dropped 7-8 feet to 4,193 feet in the summer of 2019, and approached a record low in 2018. This has resulted in xx square miles of 
exposed lakebed.
